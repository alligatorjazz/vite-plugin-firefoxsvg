# pixi-vite-starter
**A Typescript starter template for pixi.js using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool.**

Includes utility libraries [pixi-gesture-hooks](https://github.com/alligatorjazz/pixi-gesture-hooks) and [pixi-extended-graphics](https://github.com/alligatorjazz/pixi-extended-graphics).

## Why?
The other pixi.js starters I found were either old, didn't have Typescript support, or were too focused on imposing an OOP paradigm. This is a starter project that is more along the procedural & functional approach I use for building applications, and I'm going to try my best to keep it up to date as the framework changes.
